This is a project that maintains some basic and intermediate level examples of eLua running on it's supported platforms.
Each example is kept separetely in it's own sub-folder.
These examples (and others that became individual projects also found on our github repo) used to be part of our distros, included in the ROMFS.
They were removed from the distro to keep it smaller, cleaner and not oriented to a single type of audience.

You are welcomed to extend these examples to new platfoms and to add new ones too. 

For information and tutorials about each of these examples, please refer to their pages on the eLua User Labs wiki at http://wiki.eluaproject.net/Projects

The main site of the eLua Project is http://www.eluaproject.net
